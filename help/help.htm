<h1>Coco_XH &ndash; a CMSimple_XH Plugin</h1>
<img src="../coco.png" width="128" height="128" style="float:left;
margin-right:20px" alt="Box with stuff">
<p style="text-align:justify">Coco_XH facilitates to have an arbitrary amount of
so called co-contents on your website. These are similar to newsboxes, but
instead have different content for every page. Coco_XH is inspired by the <a
href="http://cmsimplewiki.com/doku.php/plugins/also">Also</a> plugin, but
allows editing with the chosen editor instead of a
textarea and scripting to be used.</p>

<p>
    This plugin requires CMSimple_XH ≥ 1.6.3 and PHP ≥ 5.4.0.</p>
<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>
</section>

<section id="installation">
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>The installation is done as with many other CMSimple_XH plugins. See the <a
href="http://www.cmsimple-xh.org/wiki/doku.php/installation"> CMSimple_XH
wiki</a> for further details.</p>
<ol>
<li>Backup the data on your server.</li>
<li>Unzip the distribution on your computer.</li>
<li>Upload the whole directory coco/ to your server into CMSimple_XH's plugins
directory.</li>
<li>Set write permissions to the subfolders css/ and languages/.</li>

</ol>
<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>
</section>

<section id="settings">
<h2>Settings</h2>
<p>The plugin's configuration is done as with many other CMSimple_XH plugins in
the website's back-end. Select Plugins &rarr; Coco.</p>
<!--
<p>You can change the default settings of Coco_XH under "Config". Hints for the
options will be displayed when hovering over the help icon with your mouse.</p>
-->
<p>Localization is done under "Language". You can translate the character
strings to your own language (if there is no appropriate language file
available), or customize them according to your needs.</p>
<p>The look of the Coco_XH can be customized under "Stylesheet". This is mainly
meant for styling the back-end. The styling of the co-content should be done by
modifying the template and its stylesheet.</p>
<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>
</section>

<section id="usage">
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>To have co-content on your site, just insert in your template</p>
<div class="code">&lt;?php echo coco('my_content');?&gt;</div>
<p>in the place where you want, e.g. instead of a newsbox. Instead of
'my_content' you can choose any name, as long as it consists of lower-case
letters (a-z), digits and underscores only. You can have as many co-contents as
you like, as long as you give them different names.</p>
<p>The screenshot shows two co-contents:</p>
<div><img src="view-mode.png" style="width:100%" alt="view-mode"></div>
<p>If you are in edit mode, you can edit the co-content
with the configured editor.
If you want to use another
toolbar than the one you have configured for the main content editor, just give
the name of the toolbar as second parameter, e.g.</p>
<div class="code">&lt;?php echo coco('small_content', 'sidebar');?&gt;</div>
<p>As toolbars usually "full", "medium", "minimal" and "sidebar" are available.
How to customize the tinyMCE toolbars is explained in the <a
href="http://www.cmsimple-xh.org/wiki/doku.php/tinymce#customization">CMSimple_XH
Wiki</a>.</p>
<p>The screenshot shows the co-contents in edit mode:</p>
<div><img src="edit-mode.png" style="width:100%" alt="edit-mode"></div>
<p>The width and height of the textarea resp. the editor default to 100% of its
container. The height can be changed by a third parameter to the coco() call,
e.g.</p>
<div class="code">&lt;?php echo coco('my_content', 'sidebar',
'500px');?&gt;</div>
<p>If you give this parameter, it's mandatory to give the toolbar parameter too.
If you want to stick with the default toolbar, you can write:</p>
<div class="code">&lt;?php echo coco('my_content', false, '500px');?&gt;</div>
<p>If you want to change the width, you can do so in the stylesheet.</p>
<p>The co-contents are stored in the subfolder coco/ of the content/ folder of CMSimple_XH in an HTML file with
the name given as first parameter, e.g. my_content.htm. The structure is similar
to that of CMSimple's content.htm file. The pages are separated by &lt;h1&gt;,
&lt;h2&gt; or &lt;h3&gt; according to their menu level. (Therefore it's not
possible to use these headings in the co-contents; they will be automatically
converted to &lt;h4&gt;.) The names of the page headings are inserted for better
readability only; they are ignored by Coco_XH. Instead the link to the page is
made with the id given for the heading. You must not alter these ids in any way!
Creating new pages by inserting new headings is not possible; these will simply
be ignored.</p>
<p>Note that a backup of all co-contents is automatically made on logout. This
is done the same way as CMSimple_XH makes backups of the content. If you
want to restore a backup, you have to do it via FTP.</p>

<section id="usage-searching">
<h3>Searching</h3>
<p>If you want CMSimple_XH's search function to search your co-contents too, you
have to replace cmsimple/search.php with plugins/coco/search.php. The search
will work the same as in CMSimple_XH 1.5.x.</p>
<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>
</section>

<section id="usage-administration">
<h3>Administration</h3>
<p>You can administrate the co-contents under Plugins &rarr; Coco &rarr;
Co-Contents. Currently it's only possible to delete co-content files that you
don't need any more. It's however important to delete those files as they will
automatically being searched by the search function; besides taking time it
might give wrong search results.</p>
