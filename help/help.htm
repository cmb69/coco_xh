<h1>Coco_XH - a CMSimple_XH Plugin</h1>
<img src="../coco.png" style="display:block; float:left; margin-right:20px">
<p style="text-align:justify">Coco_XH facilitates to have an arbitrary amount of so called co-contents on your website.
These are similar to newsboxes, but instead have different content for every page.
Coco_XH is inspired by the <a href="http://cmsimplewiki.com/doku.php/plugins/also">Also</a> plugin,
but (for CMSimple_XH &ge; 1.5 only) allows editing with the chosen editor instead of a textarea
and scripting to be used.</p>

<p><strong>Please do read this documentation! Support might not be given otherwise.
It's generally a good idea to read the documentation,
<em>before</em> you encounter any problems!</strong></p>

<h2><a name="notice">Important Notice</a></h2>
<p><strong>Coco_XH is in an early state of development, so many things might change.
Furthermore it couldn't be tested so far in various environments.
It is a so called ALPHA version. Use with utmost caution!</strong></p>
<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>

<h2><a name="requirements">Requirements</a></h2>
<p>Coco_XH is a plugin for CMSimple_XH &ge; 1.2.
It requires a UTF-8 encoded version.</p>
<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>

<h2><a name="installation">Installation</a></h2>
<p>The installation is done as with many other CMSimple_XH plugins.
See the <a href="http://www.cmsimple-xh.com/wiki/doku.php/manuals:users_manual:plugins:installation">
CMSimple_XH wiki</a> for further details.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Backup the data on your server.</strong></li>
<li>Unzip the distribution on your computer.</li>
<li>Upload the whole directory coco/ to your server into CMSimple_XH's plugins directory.</li>
<li>Set write permissions to the subdirectories config/, css/, languages/ and the plugin's data folder.</li>
<li><strong>Switch to "Coco" in the back-end to check if all requirements are fulfilled.</strong></li>
</ol>
<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>

<h2><a name="settings">Settings</a></h2>
<p>The plugin's configuration is done as with many other
CMSimple_XH plugins in the website's back-end.
Select "Coco" from "Plugins".</p>
<p>You can change the default settings of Coco_XH in "Plugin Config".
Hints for the options will be displayed
when hovering over the help icon with your mouse.</p>
<p>Localization is done in "Plugin Language".
You can translate the character strings to your own language,
or customize them according to your needs.</p>
<p>The look of the Coco_XH can be customized in "Plugin Stylesheet".
This is mainly thought for styling the back-end (which is not yet implemented though).
The styling of the co-content should be done by modifying the template and its stylesheet.
But as each textarea has an id (necessary for the editors),
you can use this id to style the textarea in the plugin stylesheet, if you prefer.</p>
<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>

<h2><a name="usage">Usage</a></h2>
<p>To have co-content on your site, just insert in your template
<span class="code">&lt;?php echo coco('my_content');?&gt;</span>
in the place where you want, e.g. instead of a newsbox.
Instead of 'my_content' you can choose any name,
as long as it consists of lower-case letters (a-z), digits and underscores only.
You can have as many co-contents as you like,
as long as you give them different names.</p>
<div><img src="view-mode.png" width="100%" alt="view-mode"></div>
<p>If you are in edit mode, you can edit the co-content,
either with a textarea or from CMSimple_XH 1.5 on with the configured editor.
Note that tinyMCE 1.0 (shipped with CMSimple_XH 1.5 and 1.5.1) doesn't work with Coco_XH,
so you have to update to a newer version.
If you want to use another toolbar than the one you have configured for the main content editor,
just give the name of the toolbar as second parameter, e.g.
<span class="code">&lt;?php echo coco('small_content', 'sidebar');?&gt;.</p>
<div><img src="edit-mode.png" width="100%" alt="edit-mode"></div>
<p>The width and height of the textarea/editor default to 100% of its container.
The height can be changed by a third parameter to the coco() call, e.g.
<span class="code">&lt;?php echo coco('my_content', 'sidebar', '500px');?&gt;</span>.
If you want to change the width, you can do so in the plugin's stylesheet.</p>
<p>The co-contents are stored in Coco_XH's data folder
in an (X)HTML file with the name given as first parameter, e.g. my_content.htm.
The structure is similar to that of CMSimple's content.htm file.
The pages are separated by &lt;h1&gt;, &lt;h2&gt; or &lt;h3&gt; according to their menu level.
The name of the page headings are inserted for better readability only;
they are ignored by Coco_XH.
Instead the link to the pages is made with the id given for the headings.
You should not alter these ids in any way!
Inserting new pages by inserting new headings is not possible;
these will simply be ignored.</p>
