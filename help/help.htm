<h1>Also_XH - a CMSimple_XH Plugin</h1>
<img src="../also.png" style="display:block; float:left; margin-right:20px">
<p style="text-align:justify">Also_XH facilitates to have an arbitrary amount of additional contents on your website.
These are similar to newsboxes, but instead have different content for every page.
Also_XH is inspired by the <a href="http://cmsimplewiki.com/doku.php/plugins/also">Also</a> plugin,
but allows editing with the chosen editor instead of a textarea (CMSimple_XH &ge; 1.5 only).</p>

<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>

<h2><a name="installation">Installation</a></h2>
<p>The installation is done as with many other CMSimple_XH plugins.

<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>

<h2><a name="settings">Settings</a></h2>
<p>The plugin's configuration is done as with many other
CMSimple_XH plugins in the website's back-end.

Hints for the options will be displayed
when hovering over the help icon with your mouse.</p>

or customize them according to your needs.</p>
<p>The look of the Also_XH can be customized in "Plugin Stylesheet".</p>
<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>

<h2><a name="usage">Usage</a></h2>
<p>Also_XH is used from the template.
To be able to edit the additional content with an editor, you have to insert
<span class="code">&lt;?php echo also_enable();?&gt;</span> <em>before</em>
<span class="code">&lt;?php echo head();?&gt;</span></p>
<p>To have additional content on your site, just insert
<span class="code">&lt;?php echo also('my_content');&gt;</span>
in the place where you want, e.g. instead of a newsbox.
Instead of 'my_content' you can choose any name,
as long as it consists of lower-case letters (a-z), digits and underscores only.
You can have as many additional contents as you like,
as long as you give them different names.</p>
<p>If you are in edit mode, you can edit the additional content,
either with a textarea or from CMSimple_XH 1.5 on with the installed editor.
Note that the tinyMCE shipped with CMSimple_XH 1.5 and 1.5.1 doesn't work with Also_XH,
so currently only CKEditor can be used.
If you want to use another toolbar than the one you have configured for the main content editor,
just give the name of the toolbar as second parameter, e.g.
<span class="code">&lt;?php echo also('small_content', 'sidebar');&gt;.</p>
<p>The additional content is stored in Also_XH's data folder
in an (X)HTML file with the name given as first parameter, e.g. my_content.htm.
The structure is similar to that of CMSimple's content.
The pages are seperated by &lt;h1&gt;, &lt;h2&gt; or &lt;h3&gt; according to their menu level.
The name of the page headings are inserted for better readability only;
they are ignored by Also_XH.
Instead the link to the pages is made with the id given for the headings.
You should not alter these id's in any way!
Inserting new pages by inserting new headings is not possible;
these will simply be ignored.</p>
